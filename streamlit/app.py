Each model includes:

- **Graphs Related to Each Model**: Visual representations of the model's performance and data patterns.
- **Predictions**: The model's forecasted values based on historical data.

**How the App Works:**

- **Fetching Models from Azure Blob Storage**: The pre-trained models are stored in Azure Blob Storage and are fetched dynamically when needed.
- **Making Predictions with Example Dataset**: The app uses an example dataset to demonstrate how the models make predictions.
- **Making Prediction for Future dates: The pre-trained models contain a method that predicts the future days (LSTM, Holt-Winters) or specific dates (Prophet) value per day.**

This setup allows for scalable storage and efficient retrieval of models, ensuring you always have access to the latest versions without needing to store large files locally.
